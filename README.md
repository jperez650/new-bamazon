Once inside the Bamazon App, you get a promp asking if you want to buy something, if your response is a yes then you'll be displayed with a table of items to choose from. Each item has an unique id, name, department, price and quantity on stock. After you choose your item and the quantity you get a response back on wheter that item is available or not, or if your transaction went through and the total you spent on the items. If you choose to buy again you are going to see the changes reflected on the table.
